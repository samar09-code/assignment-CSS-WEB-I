                        Narayani Model Secondary School was established in 2020 B.S. (1963/64 A.D.) as a night school. In its early days, the school faced numerous challenges to keep classes running. Initially, classes were conducted at Bharatpur Secondary School and later at Chitwan Secondary School. After seven years of perseverance, the school moved to its own premises in 2027 B.S., where a seven-room building was constructed to accommodate the students.<br><br>
    
                        From 2031 B.S., the school began conducting secondary-level classes during the night while offering lower secondary classes during the day. However, by 2037 B.S., due to the difficulties of running nighttime classes, the school transitioned to morning sessions. Later, all classes were held exclusively during the daytime. Over time, the school expanded its offerings: primary-level classes began in 2039 B.S., nursery classes in 2050 B.S. and +2 programs in 2061 B.S. <br><br>
    
                        Narayani Model Secondary School offers classes from Nursery to Grade 10 and +2 programs in Science and Management, affiliated with the National Examinations Board (NEB) of Nepal. The school also runs a Diploma in Information Technology program in collaboration with the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT).<br><br>
    
                        Over the years, Narayani Model Secondary School has produced outstanding results in national examinations and has a strong track record of students excelling in higher education and professional careers. The school has also earned accolades in various academic and extracurricular competitions at regional and national levels.<br><br>
    
                        Narayani Model Secondary School stands as a shining example of what a modern educational institution can achieve. With its focus on academic rigor, character development, and extracurricular enrichment, the school continues to shape the future leaders of tomorrow.
